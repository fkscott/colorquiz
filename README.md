# color quiz

based on the "react challenge" or "interview question" presented in [this video](https://youtu.be/QNYljS0_TOE). i did my own spin on the styling, added quiz statistics, and a way to customize the length of the test. this project also allowed me to explore typescript, and state management with recoil.
